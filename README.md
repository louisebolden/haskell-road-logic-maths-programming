# The Haskell Road to Logic, Maths and Programming

My worked solutions to the exercises in the book.

To compile and/or run these programs on a Mac:

1. Ensure haskell-stack has been installed: `brew install haskell-stack`
2. (Optional) Start an interpreter for your own enjoyment: `stack ghci`
3. Compile any program with `stack ghc [filename].hs`
4. Run any program to view its output with `stack runghc -- [filename].hs -o x`

You can also define functions in a file and enter `:load [filename]` in the interpreter (note: exclude file extension).

You're then able to call the function(s) in your interpreter.

Don't forget to `:reload [filename]` when you change the file contents.
